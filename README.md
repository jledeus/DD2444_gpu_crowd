##### Simulation

How boids moves in a simulation is trivially determined by the implementation and interpretation of the rules above.

To demonstrate a full simulation with all rules applied, see below.

Simulation of Rule 1,2,3 applied with 10 groups and 4 boids in each group. See report for implementation details.
